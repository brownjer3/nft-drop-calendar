# NFT Drop Calendar
NFT Drop Calendar is a web application that tracks the release day/time of new NFT drops. The main function of the calendar is to display a list of upcoming NFT drops, which contains user-generated data. Users can also browse recent NFT-related tweets and discover new NFT drops. The application is built with a React/Redux frontend and a [Rails API backend.](https://github.com/brownjer3/nft-drop-calendar-backend)
